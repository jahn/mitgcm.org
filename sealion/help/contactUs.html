How to contact us!</h1></center>
The most productive way to sort out a problem is to first check the various
<a href="sourcesOfInfo.html">sources
of in formation.</a>
<p>OK, we give in. You can contact us in several ways:
<p>If you think you have found a bug or major unexpected feature in the
code please report it to <a href="mailto:bugs@mitgcm.org">bugs@mitgcm.org</a>.
This will enter your email into a <a href="/cgi-bin/mitgcm-bugs">bug-tracking
system</a> which means you have us over a barrel if we do nothing. The
system will assign you a report number and you can track our progress.
<p>The developers receive email at <a href="mailto:support@mitgcm.org">support@mitgcm.org</a>.
The email is also forwarded to the <a href="news://mitgcm.org/mitgcm.support">newsgroup</a>
for archiving. This is your best chance of getting in contact with us all
simultaneously, but the response my be un-coordinated.
<p>Finally, you can contact us directly (ie. privately - our emails are
on the users list) but this prohibits others from learning from the process.
