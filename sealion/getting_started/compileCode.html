Compile the code</h1></center>
We'll walk you through the compilation of "exp4" which simulates zonal
flow over a Gaussian bump.
<p>From the top-level source directory, where you installed the code, cd
to verification/exp4:
<blockquote>
<pre>% cd verification/exp4</pre>
</blockquote>
There are four dsub-directories and a REAME file.
<ul>
<li>
<i>CVS/ </i>is where version information is stored by CVS. You should never
need to enter/read/change this.</li>

<br><b><i>Please don't delete this directory/information.</i></b>
<li>
<i>code/ </i>contains copies of the source code unique to this experiment
that over-ride the originals. This is our way of customizing the code.</li>

<li>
<i>input/</i> contains the input files and parameters for this experiment.</li>

<li>
<i>results/</i> contains a single text file, <i>output.txt</i>, which we
use for quickly assessing the state of the code.</li>
</ul>
Now cd into <i>input/</i> and run the configuration tool <i>genmake</i>:
<blockquote>
<pre>% cd input</pre>

<pre>% ../../../tools/genmake -mods=../code</pre>

<pre>% make depend</pre>
</blockquote>
<i>genmake</i> will create a file <i>Makefile </i>and report which packages
are being included/excluded. <i>make depend</i> figures out the file dependancies
that allows <i>make</i> to work efficiently. You'll also notice the number
of files in the current directory has greatly expanded. This are all symbolic
links to the original source code.
<p>You only need to do the above steps once; here after, you can edit the
code and re-compile with <i>make</i>.
<p>Compile and link the code:
<blockquote>
<pre>% make</pre>
</blockquote>
This will take some time, depending on your system. [Hint: compiling on
remotely mounted disks is often really slow]
<p>If all goes well, you're ready to <a href="runModel.html">run the model</a>...
