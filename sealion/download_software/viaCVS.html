Hardware/software requirements</h2></center>
This page summarises computer system requirements for using MITgcm in a
<a href=../online_documents/manual/sarch.html#fig:mitgcm_architecture_goals>
range of scenarios</a> that spans simulations on a desktop PC to simulations
run on a high-end supercomputer.&nbsp; The side bar on the left contains
links to sites from which third party software and hardware, which you
may require, can be obtained. The text below and the 
<a href=../online_documents/index.html target=mainFrame>online document</a> explain
in what situations&nbsp; you will need these items. In many cases the software
you need will already be installed on your computer system and you can
go straight ahead and <a href=../getting_started/index.html target=mainFrame>start using</a> the model.
<p><b>MITgcm</b>
<ul>
<li>
runs on a wide <a href=../online_documents/manual/targethw.html>range of computer systems.</a></li>

<li>
includes special software (called <a href=../online_documents/manual/wrapper.html>WRAPPER</a>) 
to support efficient execution and relatively easy portablity.</li>
</ul>
<b>Platforms where MITgcm is run regularly include</b>
<ul>
<li>
PC's ( both Intel and AMD processor based) running Linux.</li>

<li>
Unix workstations from Sun, SGI, HP, IBM, Compaq.</li>

<li>
Unix based PC and workstation clusters.</li>

<li>
high-end symetric multi-processor systems.</li>
</ul>

<ul>Under the WRAPPER, code also runs very efficiently on high-end vector
processing systems, if you have one.</ul>
<b>The minimum you require to run the model is</b>
<ul>
<li>
a computer runing a Unix style operating system.</li>

<li>
a Fortran 77, Fortran 90 or Fortran 95 compiler.</li>

<li>
a C compiler.</li>
</ul>
<b>To run parallel configurations you also need either</b>
<ul>
<li>
a system that supports multi-threaded programs.</li>

<li>
a system with an implementation of the MPI&nbsp;library installed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>Specialized communication software to optimizes performance on a specific
platform can also be introduced into the WRAPPER.</ul>
<b></b>
<p><br><b>Once you have your computer set up</b>
<blockquote>go here to download the model. The full distribution (including
examples with input datasets and sample output) is around 50MB. Instructions
on estimating the computing resource requirements (CPU time, memory usage
and disk space) for a set of numerical experiments can be found here.</blockquote>
