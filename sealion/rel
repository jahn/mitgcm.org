How about this.

Chris

Everyone,

We are extremely pleased to let you know that the web site and 
code for the beta of Release 1 of MITgcm are now available.

Everything is available under:

 http://mitgcm.org/sealion


In addition to code for download, the web site contains
links for browsing code on-line and browsing code documentation
on-line.

At this time, the code has been finalized and our focus
is now on finishing the documentation and web-site, both of
which will evolve rapidly over the coming weeks.
The MITgcm hardcopy documentation is in the final
stages of preparation. It too will be available
in hypertext form at the release web site as well
as in postscript and pdf formats. We are
currently making final revisions to the document and
are targetting sending out copies and adding it to the
web site in the next week.

Please feel free to try out the new code and web site.
The code contains all the state-of-the art numerics
found in the latest checkpoint. It is differentiable
using TAF and TAMC. It has been tested on many different
platforms and on a wide variety of physical problems.
Hopefully, if people can provide rapid feedback then the
beta period can be kept to a minimum.

Regards,

John, Alistair, Chris, Patrick, Daniel, Jean-Michel
