      Breaking News:  The MITgcm is now able to generate Sea-Ice Donuts.
      In a push to move forward MITgcm on the path of fundamental science and climate
      understanding, David Ferreira and Jean-Michel Campin
      simulated a Sea-ice Donut using a coupled AquaPlanet configuration (see
      movie <A href="/movies/Sea_Ice_Donut_x1.mpg">here</A>). 
      This experiment was initialized with  the T and S fields from
      a previous Aquaplanet run which has polar sea-ice caps. These
      caps are associated with salt-compensated temperature inversions in the upper
      ocean. The new run is initialized without sea-ice and within a month, large
      sea-ice caps grow over the poles, rejecting salt. This triggers convection which
      in turns brings relatively warm water to the surface and melts the ice close
      to the poles. Here we have a <A href="/movies/Sea_Ice_Donut_x1.mpg">donut</A>. 
      Look out for that chapter on aqua-planets in the next IPCC report!

       News is back by popular request. New advection schemes are currently
       being tested. Some preliminary results from the new schemes can be seen 
       <A href="/projects/advection_test_jan07/advection_testing.html">
       here.
       </A>
       The plots show a tracer being transported and stretched in the
       MITgcm advect_xz verification test. Both new schemes (OS7MP
       and Prather second-order scheme with limiting) have very low implied 
       diffusivity.
       We are currently evaluating the
       schemes to assess their implied diffusivity, with a bottle of 
       Jean-Michel's favorite Belgian
       beer going to the the least diffusive scheme - watch this space!

       A short article entitled 
       "NASA Supercomputer Improves Prospects for Ocean Climate Research"
       in the current EOS (volume 86, number 9, March 1 2005)
       gives a succinct overview of some of the advanced high-resolution
       state-estimation work being undertaken with MITgcm by members 
       of the ECCO consortium. The article describes 
       ground-breaking computational
       technologies that have enabled this work and outlines the future goals of
       this next generation planetary scale assimilation initiative. A pdf containing 
       the article can be found

	MITgcm is now able to write and (to a lesser extent) read NetCDF files.
	The framework (the "MNC" package) has been tested by numerous developers
	on literally dozens of machines and, for the past month, has been a
