 f90mapper
 ---------

Program to produce hyperlinked static analysis of a Fortran 90 program.

Usage: f90mapper -d dictionary -o directory sourcefiles.

-d dictionary: dictionary is the name of a text file containing definitions
               for each variable sourcefiles. No default.
               The dictionary file has the following format
               #  Comment
               variable { HREF="html_reference";
                          TEXT="Decsription";
                          UNITS="umits";
                          NOTES="notes";
                         }
               The { } fields are optional.
               Example dictionary entries:
               ---------------------------
               1. Variable called A2MOMXY which holds a diffusion coefficient
                  in m^2.s^-1. Discussed further in a document called manual
                  at the marker called LAPL_DIFF. Footnotes a, b and c apply
                  to A2MOMXY.
               > A2MOMXY {HREF="manual#LAPL_DIFF";
               >  TEXT="Used internally to hold lateral diffusion coefficient.";
               >  UNITS="m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>"; NOTES="a b c";}
               2. Variable calle ARR. With no hyperlinks, no units and no
                  footnotes.
               > ARR     {TEXT="Temporary three-dimensional work array.";}

    The separate utility "DefinitionParser" can be used to create a dictionary
    of variable definitions from a source code with structured comments.

               Many files are created in a subdirectory called vdb/ these include
    vdict.html           - variable dictionary. HTML file
                           containing table of variables and their
                           defintions.
    names/variable.html  - for each variable name a file is created 
                           called "variable_name".html which 
                           tabulates all the uses of that name throughout
                           sourcefiles.
    code/sourcefile.html - for each sourcefile a file is created
                           called "sourcefile_name".html which 
                           is a hypertext version of the original source.
                           Variables and procedures are hyperlinked 
                           to the variable dictionary. Procedure calls
                           are also hyperlinked to the procedure source
                           if it lies within the scope of sourcefiles.
                In the working directory a set of cross-linked html files
                with root file named "code_reference.html" are created.
                The root file can be used to browse through the entire
                code tree that was parsed.
