# To generate browseable code for the manual
# Assuming starting in directory "buildweb/code-browser"
#
# Generating the browsable code involves several stages
# 1. particular revision is checked out from cvs
# 2. definition comments are extracted
# 3. hyperlinked form of code is generated
# 4. hyperlinked form of call tree is generated ( call tree is currently static
#    and in file MakeBrowseableMITGCM/callTree.F and MakeBrowseableMITGCM/callTree.header )
#    Really it should be extracted fom the checked out code.
# 5. Stuff for web manual is put in tar file (web.tgz) and then unpacked into
#    correct place in buildweb tree.
#
# These steps are carried out by the commands below.
#
# To execute the commands simply "source" this file from the
# directory buildweb/code-browser.
#
# Note - 'release1_p5' is specified below this could be taken from an environment variable.
#
( cd MakeBrowseableMITGCM; ./makebrowseablecodepages.sh release1_p5; cp work/web.tgz ..; \rm -f work )
( cd ..; tar -xzf code-browser/web.tgz; \rm code-browser/web.tgz)
