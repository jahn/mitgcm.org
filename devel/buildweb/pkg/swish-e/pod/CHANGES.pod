=head1 Revision History

This document contains list of bug fixes and feature additions to Swish-e.

=head2 Version 2.2rc1

Release Date: August 29, 2002

Many large changes were made internally in the code, some for performance
reasons, some for feature changes and additions, and some to prepare
for new features in later versions of Swish-e.

=item * Documentation!

Documentation is now included in the source distribution as .pod
(perldoc) files, and as HTML files.  In addition, the distribution can now
generate PDF, postscript, and unix man pages from the source .pod files.
See L<README|README> for more information.

=item * Indexing and searching speed

The indexing process has been imporoved.  Depending on a number of
factors, you may see a significant improvement in indexing speed,
especially if upgrading from version 1.x.

Searching speed has also been improved.  Properties are not loaded until
results are displayed, and properties are pre-sorted during indexing to
speed up sorting results by properties while searching.

=item * Properties are written to a sepearte file

Swish-e now stores document properties in a separate file.  This means
there are now two files that make up a Swish-e index.  The default files
are C<index.swish-e> and C<index.swish-e.prop>.

This change frees memory while indexing, allowing larger collections to
be indexed in memory.

=item * Internal data stored as Properties

Pre 2.2 some internal data was stored in fixed locations within the
index, namely the file name, file size, and title.  2.2 introduced new
internal data such as the last modified date, and document summaries.
This data is considered I<meta data> since it is data about a document.

Instead of adding new data to the internal structure of the index file,
it was decided to use the MetaNames and PropertyNames feature of Swish-e
to store this meta information.  This allows for new meta data to be added
at a later time (e.g. Content-type), and provides an easy and customizable
way to print results with the C<-p> switch and the new C<-x> switch.
In addition, search results can now be sorted and limited by properties.

For example, to sort by the rank and title:

    swish-e -w foo -s swishrank desc swishtitle asc


=item * The header display has been slightly reorganized.

If you are parsing output headers in a program then you may need to
adjust your code.  There's a new switch <-H> to control the level of
header output when searching.

=item * Results are now combined when searching more than one index.

Swish-e now merges (and sorts) the results from multiple indexes when
using C<-f> to specify more than one index.  This change effects the way
maxhits (C<-m>) works.  Here's a summary of the way it works for the
different versions.


    1.3.2 - MaxHits returns first N results starting from the first index.
            e.g. maxhits=20; 15 hits Index1, 40 hits Index2
            All 15 from Index1 plus first five from Index2 = 20 hits.

    2.0.0 - MaxHits returns first N results from each index.
            e.g. Maxhits=20; 15 hits Index1, 40 hits Index2
            All 15 from Index1 plus 15 from Index2.

    2.2.0 - Results are merged and first N results are returned.
            e.g. Maxhits=20; 15 hits Index1, 40 hits Index2
            Results are merged from each index and sorted
            (rank is the default sort) and only the first
            20 are returned.


=item * New B<prog> document source indexing method

You can now use -S prog to use an external program to supply documents
to Swish-e.  This external program can be used to spider web servers,
index databases, or to convert any type of document into html, xml,
or text, so it can be indexed by Swish-e.  Examples are given in the
C<prog-bin> directory.

=item * The indexing parser was rewritten to be more logical.

TranslateCharacters now is done before WordCharacters is checked.  For example,

    WordCharacters abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    TranslateCharacters ñ n

Now C<El Niño> will be indexed as El Nino (el and nino), even though C<ñ>
is not listed in WordCharacters.

Previously, stopwords were checked after stemming and soundex conversions,
as well as most of the other word checks (WordCharacters, min/max length
and so on).  This meant that the stopword list probably didn't work as
expected when using stemming.

=item * The search parser was rewritten to be more logical

The search parser was rewritten to correct a number of logic errors.
Swish-e did not differentiate between meta names, Swish-e operators
and search words when parsing the query.  This meant, for example,
that metanames might be broken up by the WordCharacters setting, and
that they could be stemmed.

Swish-e operator characters C<"*()=> can now be searched by escaping
with a backslash.  For example:

    ./swish-e -w 'this\=odd\)word'

will end up searching for the word C<this=odd)word>.  To search for a
backslash character preceed it with a backslash.

Currently, searching for:

    ./swish-e -w 'this\*'

is the same as a wildcard search.  This may be fixed in the future.    

Searching for buzzwords with those characters will still require
backslashing.  This also may change to allow some un-escaped operator
characters, but some will always need to be escaped (e.g. the double-quote
phrase character).

=item * Quotes and Backslash escapes in strings

A bug was fixed in the C<parse_line()> function (in F<string.c>) where
backslashes were not escaping the next character.  C<parse_line()> is used
to parse a string of text into tokens (words).  Normally splitting is done
at whitespace.  You may use quotes (single or double) to define a string
(that might include whitespace) as a single parameter.  The backslash
can also be used to escape the following character when *within* quotes
(e.g. to escape an embedded quote character).

    ReplaceRules append "foo bar"   <- define "foo bar" as a single word
    ReplaceRules append "foo\"bar"  <- escape the quotes
    ReplaceRules append 'foo"bar'   <- same thing


=item * Example C<user.config> file removed.

Previous versions of Swish-e included a configuration file called
C<user.config> which contained examples of all directives.  This has
been replaced by a series of example configuration files located in the
C<conf> directory.  The configuration directives are now described in
L<SWISH-CONFIG|SWISH-CONFIG>.

=item * Ports to Win32 and VMS

David Norris has included the files required to build Swish-e under
Windows.  See C<src/win32>.  A self-extracting Windows version is
available from the Download page of the swish-e.org web site.

Jean-François Piéronne has provided the files required to build Swish-e
under OpenVMS.  See C<src/vms> for more information.

=item * String properties are concatenated

Multiple I<string> properties of the same name in a document are now
concatenated into one property.  A space character is added between
the strings if needed.  A warning will be generated if multiple numeric
or date properties are found in the same document, and the additional
properties will be ignored.

Previously, properties of the same name were added to the index, but
could not be retrieved.

To do: remove the C<next> pointer, and allow user-defined character to
place between properties.

=item * regex type added to ReplaceRules

A more general purpose pattern replacement syntax.


=item * New Parsers

Swish-e's XML parser was replaced with James Clark's expat XML parser
library.

Swish-e can now use Daniel Veillard's libxml2 library for parsing HTML and
XML.  This requires installation of the library before building Swish-e.
See the L<INSTALL|INSTALL> document for information.  libxml2 is not
required, but is strongly recommended for parsing HTML over Swish-e's
internal HTML parser, and provides more features for both HTML and
XML parsing.

=item * Support for zlib

Swish-e can be compiled with zlib.  This is useful for compressing large
properties.  Building Swish-e with zlib is stronly recommended if you
use its C<StoreDescription> feature.

=item * LST type of document no longer supported

LST allowed indexing of files that contained multiple documents.

=item * Temporary files

To improve security Swish-e now uses the C<mkstemp(3)> function to
create temporary files.  Temporary files are used while indexing only.
This may result in some portability issues, but the security issues
were overriding.

(Currently this does not apply to the -S http indexing method.)

C<mkstemp> opens the temporary with O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags.  This prevents
overwriting existing files.  In addition, the name of the file created
is a lot harder to guess by attackers.  The temporary file is created
with only owner permissions.

Please report any portability issues on the Swish-e discussion list.

=item * Temporary file locations

Swish-e now uses the environment variables C<TMPDIR>, C<TMP>, and
C<TEMP> (in that order) to decide where to write temporary files.
The configuration setting of L<TmpDir|SWISH-CONFIG/"item_TmpDir"> will
be used if none of the environment variables are set.  Swish-e uses the
current directory otherwise; there is no default temporary directory.

Since the environment variables override the configuration settings,
a warning will be issued if you set L<TmpDir|SWISH-CONFIG/"item_TmpDir">
in the configuration file and there's also an environment variable set.

Temporary files begin with the letters "swtmp" (which can be changed in
F<config.h>), followed by two or more letters that indicate the type of
temporary file, and some random characters to complete the file name.
If indexing is aborted for some reason you may find these temporary
files left behind.

=item * New Fuzzy indexing method Double Metaphone

Based on Lawrence Philips' Metaphone algorithm, add two
new methods of creating a fuzzy index (in addition to Stemming and Soundex).


=back

Changes to Configuration File Directives.  Please see
L<SWISH-CONFIG|SWISH-CONFIG> for more info.

=over 4

=item * New directives: IndexContents and DefaultContents

The IndexContents directive assigns internal Swish-e document parsers
to files based on their file type.  The DefaultContents directive
assigns a parser to be used on file that are not assigned a parser with
IndexContents.

=item * New directive: UndefinedMetaTags [error|ignore|index|auto]

This describes what to do when a meta tag is found in a document that
is not listed in the MetaNames directive.

=item * New directive: IgnoreTags

Will ignore text with the listed tags.

=item * New directive: SwishProgParameters *list of words*

Passes words listed to the external Swish-e program when running with
C<-S prog> document source method.

=item * New directive: ConvertHTMLEntities [yes|no]

Controls parsing and conversion of HTML entities.

=item * New directive: DontBumpPositionOnMetaTags

The word position is now bumped when a new metatag is found -- this is
to prevent phrases from matching across meta tags.  This directive will
disable this behavior for the listed tags.

This directive works for HTML and XML documents.

=item * Changed directive: IndexComments

This has been changed such that comments are not indexed by default.

=item * Changed directive: IgnoreWords

The builtin list of stopwords has been removed. Use of the SwishDefault
word will generate a warning, and no stop words will be used.  You must
now specify a list of stopwords, or specify a file of stopwords.

A sample file C<stopwords.txt> has been included in the F<conf/stopwords>
directory of the distribution, and can be used by the directive:

    IgnoreWords File: /path/to/stopwords.txt

=item * Change of the default for IgnoreTotalWordCountWhenRanking

The default is now "yes".

=item * New directive: Buzzwords

Buzzwords are words that should be indexed as-is, without checking
for stopwords, word length, WordCharacters, or any other of the word
limiting features.  This allows indexing of things like C<C++> when "+"
is not listed in WordCharacters.

Currenly, IgnoreFirstChar and IgnoreLastChar will be stripped before
processing Buzzwords.

In the future we may use separate IgnoreFirst/Last settings for buzzwords
since, for example, you may wish to index all C<+> within Swish-e words,
but strip C<+> from the start/end of Swish-e words, but not from the
buzzword C<C++>.

=item * New directives: PropertyNamesNumeric PropertyNamesDate

Before Swish-e 2.2 all user-defined document properties were stored in
the index as strings.  PropertyNamesNumeric and PropertyNamesDate tell
it that a property should be stored in binary format.  This allows
for correct sorting of numeric properties.

Currenly, only integers can be stored, such as a unix timestamp.  (Swish-e
uses C<strtoul> to convert the number to an unsigned long internally.)

PropertyNamesDate only indicates to Swish-e that a number is a unix
timestamp, and to display the property as a formatted time when printing
results.  Swish does not currently parse date strings; you must provide
a unix timestamp.

=item * New directive: MetaNameAlias

You may now create alias names for MetaNames.  This allow you to map or
group multiple names to the same MetaName.

=item * New directive: PropertyNameAlias

Creates aliases for a PropertyName.

=item * New directive: PropertyNamesMaxLength

Sets the max length of a text property.

=item * New directive: HTMLLinksMetaName

Defines a metaname to use for indexing href links in HTML documents.
Available only with libxml2 parser.

=item * New directive: ImageLinksMetaName

Defines a metaname to use for indexing src links in <img> tags.
Allow you to search image pathnames within HTML pages.  Available only
with libxml2 parser.

=item * New directive: IndexAltTagMetaName

Allows indexing of image ALT tags.  Only available when using the libxml2 parser.

=item * New directive: AbsoluteLinks

Attempts to convert relative links indexed with HTMLLinksMetaName and
ImageLinksMetaName to absolute links.  Available only with libxml2 parser.

=item * New directive: ExtractPath

Allows you to use a regular expression to extract out part of the path
of each file and index it with a meta name.  For example, this allows
searches to be limited to parts of your file tree.

=item * New directive: FileMatch

FileMatch is similar to FileRules.  Where FileRules is used to exclude
files and directoires, FileMatch is used to I<include> files.

=item * New directive: PreSortedIndex

Controls which properties are pre-sorted while indexing.  All properties
are sorted by default.

=item * New directive: ParserWarnLevel

Sets the level of warning printed when using libxml2.

=item * New directive: obeyRobotsNoIndex [yes|NO]

When using libxml2 to parse HTML, Swish-e will skip files marked as
NOINDEX.

    <meta name="robots" content="noindex">

Also, comments may be used within HTML and XML source docs to block sections of
content from indexing:

       <!-- SwishCommand noindex -->
       <!-- SwishCommand index -->

and/or these may be used also:

       <!-- noindex -->
       <!-- index -->


=item * New directive: UndefinedXMLAttributes

This describes how the content of XML attributes should be indexed,
if at all.  This is similar to UndefinedMetaTags, but is only for XML
attributes and when parsed by libxml2.  The default is to not index
XML attributes.

=item * New directive: XMLClassAttributes

XMLClassAttributes can specify a list of attribute names whose content
is combined with the element name to form metanames.

=item * New directive: PropCompressionLevel [0-9]

If compiled with zlib, Swish-e uses this setting to control the level
of compression applied to properties.  Properties must be long enough
(defined in config.h) to be compressed.  Useful for StoreDescription.

=item * Experimental directive: IgnoreNumberChars

Defines a set of characters.  If a word is made of of *only* those
characters the word will not be indexed.

=item * New directive: FuzzyIndexingMode

This configuration directive is used to define the type of "fuzzy" index to create.
Currently the options are:

    None
    Stemming
    Soundex
    Metaphone
    DoubleMetaphone



=back

Changes to command line arguments.  See L<SWISH-RUN|SWISH-RUN> for
documentation on these switches.

=over 4

=item * New command line argument C<-H>

Controls the level (verbosity) of header information printed with
search results.

=item * New command line argument C<-x>

Provides additional header output and allows for a I<format string>
to describe what data to print.

=item * New command line argument C<-k>

Prints words stored in the Swish-e index.

=item * New command line argument C<-N>

Provides a way to do incremental indexing by comparing last modification
dates.  You pass C<-N> a path to a file and only files newer than the
last modified date of that file will be indexed.

=item * Removed command line argument C<-D>

C<-D> no longer dumps the index file data.  Use C<-T> instead.

=item * New command line argument C<-T>

C<-T> is used for debugging indexing and searching.

=item * Enhanced command line argument C<-d>

Now C<-d> can accept some back-slashed characters to be used as output
separators.

=item * Enhanced command line argument C<-P>

Now -P sets the phrase delimiter character in searches.

=item * New command line argument C<-L>

Swish-e 2.2 contains an B<experimental> feature to limit results by a
range of property values.  This behavior of this feature may change in
the future.

=item * Modified command line argument C<-v>

Now the argument C<-v 0> results in *no* output unless there is an error.
This is a bit more handy when indexing with cron.
