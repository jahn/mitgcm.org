INSTALL - Swish-e Installation Instructions

=head1 OVERVIEW

This document describes how to download, build and install Swish-e.
Also described is how to build Swish-e with optional, yet recommended libraries that
extend and enhance Swish-e.

This document also provides instructions on how to get help installing
and using Swish-e (and the important information you should provide when asking for help).

Also, below is a basic overview of using Swish-e to index documents, with pointers to
other more advanced examples.

For those in a hurry, see L<"Quick Start for the Impatient">.

=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Swish-e 2.x is written in C, and, up to this time, it has been tested on
Solaris 2.6, AIX 4.3.2, OpenVMS 7.2-1 AXP, RedHat Linux 6.2 (and other
Linux distributions) and Win32 platforms.

Unless you are using the Win32 binary distribution, a C compiler is needed.
Pretty much any standard compiler should do, although you will probably
have best luck with a current version of gcc. If you are using something
else (such as HP-UX or AIX) you may see more warnings during the build
process.  Any problems should be sent to the Swish-e discussion list
after searching the list archives.

B<libxml2>

http://www.xmlsoft.org/

Swish-e 2.2 can (and probably should) use the libxml2 library for parsing
HTML and XML files.  Instructions for installing and enabling the library
are described below.

Currently, the libxml2 library is not required, but is a much better
parser than the tired old Swish-e html parser (html.c).  Please see
the Swish-e FAQ L<SWISH-FAQ|SWISH-FAQ> for more discussion of the use
of libxml2.

Swish-e's old xml.c paser has been rewritten to use James Clark's Expat
library (included with the Swish-e distribution), but Swish-e's old
html.c code is still broken in a number of ways.  Libxml2 is comparable to
Expat, but offers a much better HTML parser that Swish-e's html.c parser.
Use libxml2 if possible for parsing HTML and XML.

Currently, setting a content type
(L<IndexContents|SWISH-CONFIG/"item_IndeContents"> or L<DefaultContents|"SWISH-CONFIG/"DefaultContents">)
of "HTML" uses Swish-e's html.c parser, where a setting of "HTML2" uses libxml2's HTML parser.
Likewise, a setting of "XML" uses the included Expat library, where "XML2"
uses libxml2 for parsing XML.  All this may change in future releases.

B<zlib compression>

http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

Swish-e can make use of zlib to compress document properties.  This is recommended
if you are using L<StoreDescription|SWISH-CONFIG/"item_StoreDescription">.

A Swish-e program built with zlib will read an index from a version of Swish-e that
was not built with zlib.  But, if you are searching an index that was compressed with
zlib then you will need to use a version of Swish-e built with zlib.  Therefore, it's
recommended to always include zlib support.


B<Memory>

Swish needs quite a bit of memory while indexing.  How much depends
on what you are indexing.  The index is portable between platforms,
so you can index on a machine that has lots of memory available and
move the index files to another machine for searching.  Use the C<-e>
switch if you are short on memory.

B<Perl modules>

http://www.cpan.org

http://search.cpan.org

Swish-e uses a perl script for spidering web sites.  The script 
requires the LWP bundle of modules (see http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=libwww-perl ).
(Note: depending on your perl installation, you might need to install additional modules required
by LWP; for requirements and downloads check http://www.cpan.org
or http://search.cpan.org).  The Perl helper script was tested with
perl 5.005, 5.6.0, and 5.6.1 although it should probably work with any version 5 release.
Do note that the LWP, HTTP, and HTML modules are updated often for bug
fixes and such -- do check for upgrades, and don't expect that your system admin
as been keeping up with bug fixes.


=head2 Platform Specific Information

A C<configure> script is used to determine platform specific details
for building swish.  Please contact the Swish-e discussion list if you
notice any platform specific problems while building Swish-e.

Specific information for various platforms can be found in subdirectories
of the C<src> directory.  For example, the Win32 files can be found
in C<src/win32>, and instructions for building under VMS can be found
in C<src/vms>.

The Windows binary is distributed as a separate package from the source
distribution.  See http://Swish-e.org for download information.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Instructions below are for installing Swish-e from source.
Installing from source is recommended, but you should also check
the Swish-e web site for binary distributions for your platform.

Windows binary distributions are available from the Swish-e site.

=head2 Brief Instructions

    ./configure
    make
    make test
    su root
    make install

Swish uses a F<configure> script to generate a Makefile for your platform.
The F<configure> script should detect and use optional libraries if found on
your system.

=head2 Using libxml2 parser library  (optional, but recommended)

Daniel Veillard's libxml2 is a well supported library for working with
HTML and XML documents.  As of version 2.2 Swish-e can use libxml2 to parse HTML and
XML documents.

Installing the libxml2 library is not required at this time, but is
recommended, espeically if you are parsing HTML.  As mentioned above,
the XML parser that is included with swish uses James Clarks's Expat
library and works well.  The HTML parser in Swish-e has been in use for
years, but the parser provided by libxml2 is preferred.  The libxml2
HTML parser offers more features (and more features for parsing XML), and
is more accurate.  If you are running Linux it may already be installed
(look for libxml2.so.2.4.5 or higher).

The library can be downloaded from http://www.xmlsoft.org/.  Installation
directions are included in the INSTALL file in the libxml2 package.
Uncompressing, building, and installation of libxml2 is very similar to
the way Swish-e is built.

Many Linux distributions provide libxml2 packages directly via RPM or
the Debian pacakage system.  Check with your distributions web site for
more information, as this is a very easy way to install this library.

If libxml2 complains during compilation that it can not find zlib then
you may need to specify the location of zlib.  This happens (on Solaris)
when the ./configure script finds the zlib header files, but the compiler
and linker do not know to look in /usr/local/lib for the library.
You may see an error like:

    ld: fatal: library -lz: not found
    ld: fatal: File processing errors. No output written to .libs/libxml2.so.2.4.5
    *** Error code 1

In this case, try specifying where zlib can be found.  For example,
if libz was located in /usr/local/lib you would use this when building
B<libxml2>:

    # building libxml2 (not swish)
    ./configure --with-zlib=/usr/local

Swish-e doesn't use libxml2 uncompression features, so you *should*
be able to disable zlib when building B<libxml2>:

    ./configure --without-zlib

B<NOTE:> But, that doesn't seem to work at this time (as of version
libxml2-2.4.5).

If you do not have root access you can specify a prefix when building B<libxml2>:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local

This will install the headers and library files in F<$HOME/local/include>
and F<$HOME/local/lib>.  You will need to inform the Swish-e build
process of this non-standard directory location (explained below).

Once you run the libxml2 F<configure> script you build and install the library
as the libxml2 F<INSTALL> page instructs:

    make
    make install


B<Building Swish-e with libxml2>

Swish will try to detect if libxml2 is installed in the standard library locations.

If libxml2 is installed in your system and you do B<not> want to build with libxml2:

    ./configure --without-libxml2

If libxml2 was installed in a non-standard location then specify the
path where libxml2 was installed.  For example,

    ./configure --with-libxml2=$HOME/local

If libxml2 is installed in a non-standard location, Swish-e needs to know
where that library is at run time.  There seems to be a number of ways
to do this.  First, you can set the environment variable C<LD_RUN_PATH>
*before* running make to create Swish-e.  This will add the path directly
to the Swish-e executable file.

For example, under Bourne type shells:

    LD_RUN_PATH=$HOME/local/lib make

Other shells (like csh and tcsh) may require:

    setenv LD_RUN_PATH $HOME/local/lib
    make

Another option is to use the C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH> environment variable.
This is a list of directories to search for libraries when a program
is run.  See the ld(8) man page for more info.

Note that libxml2 will be linked as a shared library on many platforms, so once you
compile Swish-e to use the library, the libxml2 library must not be
deleted or moved.

=head2 Building Swish-e with zlib

Building with zlib is similar to the instructions for building Swish-e
with libxml2 above.  The F<configure> script will attempt to detect if zlib is
installed in your system and if found link Swish-e with the zlib library.

zlib is common on many systems, but may be out of date, and versions prior to 1.1.4
have a know security issue.  You should run
at least version 1.1.4.  To link with zlib in a non-standard location use,
for example:

    ./configure --with-zlib=$HOME/zlib

Again, as with compiling libxml2, you may need to use the C<LD_RUN_PATH>
or C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH> variables.  See above for more details.


=head2 Downloading and unpacking and building Swish-e

If you are reading this INSTALL document, then you probably already have
downloaded and unpacked the distribution.  But just in case...

Make sure you are using the current release from
http://Swish-e.org.  If you have any questions about which version to use, please
ask on the Swish-e discussion list.

How you download Swish-e is up to you: lynx, lwp-download,
wget are all common methods.

=over 3

=item 1 Uncompress the distribution file


   gzip -dc swish-e.x.x.tar.gz | tar xof -

or on some versions of tar, simply

   tar -zxof swish-e.x.x.tar.gz

Uncompressing should create the following directories:   

   swish-e-x.x/            configure script and top-level Makefile
   swish-e-x.x/pod/        Swish-e documentation
   swish-e-x.x/html/       HTML version of the documentation
   swish-e-x.x/src/        source code
   swish-e-x.x/conf/       example configuration files and stopword files
   swish-e-x.x/example/    working example CGI scripts
   swish-e-x.x/filter-bin/ filter samples
   swish-e-x.x/prog-bin/   -S prog a web spider and other examples
   swish-e-x.x/perl/       perl interface to the Swish-e C library
   swish-e-x.x/src/expat/  James Clark's Expat XML parser
   swish-e-x.x/src/win32/  win32 binary and buid files
   swish-e-x.x/src/vms/    files required for building under VMS
   swish-e-x.x/tests/      tests used for running "make test"
   swish-e-x.x/doc/        directory used or building the documentation


=item 2 Make any needed changes in F<src/config.h>

Compile-time configuration settings are adjusted in the file
F<src/config.h>.  Most of the settings may also be specified in the
configuration file used during indexing.

You probably will B<not> need to change this file, but it's helpful
to become familiar with the default compiled-in settings.

=item 3 Build Swish-e

Building Swish-e on most systems is a simple procedure.  In the
Swish-e-x.x/ top level directory type the following commands

   ./configure
   make
   make test

You should build swish as a normal user (i.e. not as "root").

Note: If you wish to use libxml2 or zlib please see the previous section
for the required configure options.

The above will create the Swish-e executable F<src/swish-e> and test
that the executable is working correctly.  C<make test> will generate
an index file in the F<tests> directory and run a number of searches
against this index.  At this time, the tests really just make sure that swish-e
was compiled correctly and runs.

You may optionally "build" the F<swish-search> executable.  This is
a version of Swish-e that cannot write to the index file.  This
version may provide somewhat improved security in a CGI environment.
The binaries F<swish-e> and F<swish-search> are the same files -- the
additional security is enabled when the binary is named I<swish-search>.
F<swish-search> is not a substitute for good file system and CGI security.
Please review the many CGI security papers available on-line.

Again, this is an optional step:

   make swish-search

which simply copies the file F<swish-e> to F<swish-search>.

=item 4 Install Swish-e

Move the F<swish-e> (and/or F<swish-search>) executable to its final
location (normally /usr/local/bin).  You may simply copy the program
anywhere you see fit, or you may use the C<make install> command to
install it to the location defined by the F<configure> script:

You may need to superuser privileges:

   su root
   make install
   exit

B<IMPORTANT:> Do not run swish-e as the superuser (root).

The bin directory may be set when first running F<./configure>. For example:

   ./configure --bindir=$HOME/bin

sets the installation directory to F<$HOME/bin> and C<make install>
will install the program in that location.

=head2 Join the Swish-e discussion list

The Swish-e discussion list is the place to ask questions about installing
and using Swish-e, see or post bug fixes or security announcements, and
a place where B<you> can offer help to others.

The list is typically I<very low traffic>, so it won't overload your
inbox.  Please take time to subscribe.  See http://Swish-e.org.

If you are using Swish-e on a public site, please let the list know so
it can be added to the list of sites that use Swish-e!

Please review L<QUESTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING|QUESTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING> before posting
a question to the Swish-e list.

=head2 Installing the Swish-e C Library (optional)

Swish 2.2 creates the C library F<libswish-e.a> during the build.
Install this library if you wish to embed Swish-e into another
application.  For example, the library should be installed
before using the high level Perl SWISH modules located on
CPAN. http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=SWISH

This is an *optional* step.  Most users will not need to install the library.

To install the library issue the following commands (again, you may need
to su root)

   su root
   make install-lib
   exit

By default this will install the library in /usr/local/lib, but this
directory can be set when running ./configure with the --libdir option.
For example:

   ./configure --bindir=$HOME/bin --libdir=$HOME/lib

So C<make install> will install the F<swish-e> binary in F<$HOME/bin>
and C<make install-lib> will install the F<libswish-e.a> library in
F<$HOME/lib>.

Note: You may wish to run C<make realclean> before running ./configure again.

=head2 Creating PDF and Postscript documentation (optional)

The Swish-e documentation in HTML format was created with Pod::HtmlPsPdf,
a package of Perl modules written and/or modified by Stas Bekman to automate
the conversion of documents in pod format (see perldoc perlpod) to HTML,
Postscript, and PDF.  A slightly modified version of this package is
include with the Swish-e distribution and used for building the HTML.

If your system has the B<necessary tools> to build Postscript and the
converter ps2pdf installed, you may be able to build the Postscript
and PDF versions of the documentation.  After you have run ./configure,
type from the top-level directory of the distribution:

    make pdf

And with any luck you will end up with the these two files in the top-level directory:

    swish-e_documentation.pdf
    swish-e_documentation.ps

Most people find reading the documentation in HTML most convenient.

=head2 Installing the Swish-e documentation as man(1) pages (optional)

Part of the included Swish-e documentation can be installed as system
man(1) pages.  Only the reference related pages are installed (it's
assumed that you don't need to install the README or INSTALL documents as
man pages).  You must have the pod2man program installed on your system
(which you probably do if you have Perl).

To build the man pages and install them into your system, type from the
top-level directory (after running ./configure):

    su root
    make install-man
    exit

You will need to C<su root> if you do not have write access to the man directory.

The man pages are installed in the system man directory.  This directory
is determined by running ./configure and can be set by passing the
directory when running ./configure.

For example,

    ./configure --mandir=/usr/local/doc/man

Information on running ./configure can be found by typing:

    ./configure --help

The pod source files used to create the man files were written running
under perl 5.6.1.  Older version of Perl may complain slightly about the
formatting of the pod files.  This shouldn't be a problem, but please
let the Swish-e list know if otherwise.  Then upgrade your version of perl. ;)

=head1 QUESTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING

Please search the Swish-e list archive before posting a question, and
check the L<SWISH-FAQ|SWISH-FAQ> to see if your question hasn't already
been asked.

Support for installation, configuration and usage is available via the
Swish-e discussion list.  Visit http://swish-e.org for information.
Do not contact developers directly for help -- always post your question
to the list.

Before posting use tools available to narrow down the problem.

Swish-e has the -T, -v, and -k switches that may help resolve issues.
If possible find a single document that shows the problem, then index
with -T INDEXED_WORDS and watch the exact words that are indexed.
Use -H 9 when searching and look at C<Parsed Words:> to make sure you
are searching the correct words.

You can also use programs like C<gdb> to help find segfaults and other
run-time errors, and programs like C<truss> or C<strace> can often
provide interesting information, if you are adventurous.

=head2 When posting please provide the following information:

=over 4

=item *

The exact version of Swish-e that you are using.  Running Swish-e with the
C<-V> switch will print the version number.  Also, supply the output from
C<uname -a> or similar command that identifies the operating system you
are running on.  If you are running an old version of swish be prepared
for a response to your question of "upgrade."

=item *

A summary of the problem.  This should include the commands issued
(e.g. for indexing or searching) and their output, and why you don't
think it's working correctly.  Please cut-n-paste the exact commands
and their output instead of retyping to avoid errors.

=item *

Include a copy of the configuration file you are using, if any.  Swish-e
has reasonable defaults so in many cases you can run it without using
a configuration file.  But, if you need to use a configuration file,
reduce it down to the absolute minimum number of commands required to
demonstrate your problem.  Again, cut-n-paste.

=item *

A small copy of a source document that demonstrates the problem.

If you are having problems spidering a web server, use lwp-download or
wget to copy the file locally to make sure you can index the document
using the file system method.

If you do need help with spidering, don't post fake URLs, as it makes it
impossible to help.  If you don't want to expose your web page to the
people on the Swish-e list, find some other site to test spidering on.
If that works, but you still cannot spider your own site then post your
real URL if you want help.

=item *

If you are having trouble building Swish-e please cut-n-paste the output
from make (or from ./configure if that's where the problem is).


=back

=head1 BASIC CONFIGURATION AND USAGE

This section should give you a basic overview of indexing and searching
with B<Swish-e>.  Other examples can be found in the F<conf> directory, which will
step you through a number of different configurations.
Also, please review the L<SWISH-FAQ|SWISH-FAQ>.

Swish-e reads a configuration file (see L<SWISH-CONFIG|SWISH-CONFIG>)
for directives that control what and how Swish-e indexes files.
Then running Swish-e is controlled by command line arguments (see
L<SWISH-RUN|SWISH-RUN>).

Swish-e does not require a configuration file, but
most people need to change the default behavior by placing settings
in a configuration file.

To try the examples below change to the F<tests> subdirectory of the
distribution.  The tests will use the *.html files in this directory when
creating the test index.  You may wish to review these *.html files to
get an idea of the various native file formats that Swish-e supports.

=head2 Step 1: Create a Configuration File

The configuration file controls what and how Swish-e indexes.  The
configuration file consists of directives, comments, and blank lines.
The configuration file can be any name you like.

This example will work with the documents in the F<tests> directory.
You may wish to review the F<tests/test.config> configuration file used
for the C<make test> tests.

For example, a simple configuration file (F<Swish-e.conf>):

    # Example Swish-e Configuration file

    # Define *what* to index
    # IndexDir can point to a directories and/or a files

    # Here it's pointing to the current directory
    IndexDir .

    # But only index the .html files
    IndexOnly .html

    # Show basic info while indexing
    IndexReport 1

And that's a simple configuration file.  It says to index all the
.html files in the current directory, and provide some basic output
while indexing.

The complete list of all configuration file directives are described
in L<SWISH-CONFIG|SWISH-CONFIG>.

=head2 Step 2: Index your Files

Now, make sure you are in the F<tests> directory and save the above
example configuration file as F<swish-e.conf>.  Then run Swish-e using
the C<-c> switch to specify the name of the configuration file.

    ../src/swish-e -c swish-e.conf

    Indexing Data Source: "File-System"
    Indexing "."
    Removing very common words...
    no words removed.
    Writing main index...
    Sorting words ...
    Sorting 55 words alphabetically
    Writing header ...
    Writing index entries ...
      Writing word text: Complete
      Writing word hash: Complete
      Writing word data: Complete
    55 unique words indexed.
    Writing file list ...
    Property Sorting complete.                                         
    Writing sorted index ...
    5 files indexed.  1252 total bytes.
    Elapsed time: 00:00:00 CPU time: 00:00:00
    Indexing done!

This created the index file F<index.swish-e>.  This is the default
index file name unless the B<IndexFile> directive is specified in the
configuration file:

    IndexFile ./website.index

=head2 Step 3: Search

You specify your search terms with the C<-w> switch.  For example, to find
the files that contain the word B<sample> you would issue the command:

    ../src/swish-e -w sample

This example assumes that you are in the F<tests> directory, and the
Swish-e binary is in the F<../src> directory.  Swish-e returns in response
to that command the following:

    ../src/swish-e -w sample

    # SWISH format: 2.2
    # Search words: sample
    # Number of hits: 2
    # Search time: 0.000 seconds
    # Run time: 0.005 seconds
    1000 ./test_xml.html "If you are seeing this, the METATAG XML search was successful!" 159
    1000 ./test.html "If you are seeing this, the test was successful!" 437
    .

So the word B<sample> was found in two documents.  The first number
shown is the relevance or rank of the search term, followed by the file
containing the search term, the title of the document, and finally the
length of the document.

The period (".") alone at the end marks the end of results.

Much more information may be retrieved while searching by using
the C<-x> and C<-H> switches (see L<SWISH-RUN|SWISH-RUN>)
and by using Document Properties (see L<SWISH-CONFIG|SWISH-CONFIG>).

=head2 Phrase Searching

To search for a phrase in a document use double-quotes to delimit your
search terms.  (The phrase delimiter is set in src/swish.h.)

You must protect the quotes from the shell.

For example, under Unix:

    swish-e -w '"this is a pharase" or (this and that)'
    swish-e -w 'meta1=("this is a pharase") or (this and that)'

Or under Windows F<command.com> shell.

    swish-e -w \"this is a pharase\" or (this and that)

The phrase delimiter can be set with the C<-P> switch.

=head2 Boolean Searching

You can use the Boolean operators B<and>, B<or>, or B<not> in searching.
Without these Boolean, Swish-e will assume you're B<and>ing the words together.

Here are some examples:

    ../src/swish-e -w 'apples oranges'
    ../src/swish-e -w 'apples and oranges'  ( Same thing )

    ../src/swish-e -w 'apples or oranges'

    ../src/swish-e -w 'apples or oranges not juice' -f myIndex 

retrieves first the files that contain both the words "apples" and "oranges";
then among those the ones that do not contain the word "juice"

A few others to ponder:

    ../src/swish-e -w 'apples and oranges or pears'
    ../src/swish-e -w '(apples and oranges) or pears'  ( Same thing )
    ../src/swish-e -w 'apples and (oranges or pears)'  ( Not the same thing )

See L<SWISH-SEARCH|SWISH-SEARCH> for more information.    


=head2 Context Searching

The C<-t> option in the search command line allows you to search for
words that exist only in specific HTML tags.  Each character in the
string you specify in the argument to this option represents a different
tag in which the word is searched; that is you can use any combinations
of the following characters:

    H means all <HEAD> tags
    B stands for <BODY> tags
    t is all <TITLE> tags
    h is <H1> to <H6> (header) tags
    e is emphasized tags (this may be <B>, <I>, <EM>, or <STRONG>)
    c is HTML comment tags (<!-- ... -->)

For example:

    # Find only documents with the word "linux" in the E<lg>TITLEE<gt> tags.
    ./swish-e -w linux -t t

    # Find the word "apple" in titles or comments
    ./swish-e -w apple -t tc


=head2 META Tags

For the last example we will instruct Swish-e to use META tags to define
I<fields> in your documents.

META names are a way to define "fields" in your documents.  You can
use the META names in your queries to limit the search to just the words
contained in that META name of your document.  For example, you might have
a META tagged field in your documents called C<subjects> and then you can
search your documents for the word "foo" but only return documents where
"foo" is within the C<subjects> META tag.

Document I<Properties> are somewhat related to meta tags:  Properties
allow the contents of a META tag in a source document to be stored within
the index, and that text to be returned along with search results.

META tags can have two formats in your documents.

    <META NAME="keyName" CONTENT="some Content">

And in XML format

    <keyName>
        Some Content
    </keyName>

If using libxml, you can optionally use a non-html tag as a metaname:

    <html>
    <body>
        Hello swish users!
        <keyName>
            this is meta data
        </keyName>.
    </body>

This, of course, is invalid HTML.

To continue with our sample F<Swish-e.conf> file, add the following lines:

    # Define META tags
    MetaNames meta1 meta2 meta3

Reindex to include the changes:

    ../src/swish-e -c swish-e.conf

Now search, but this time limit your search to META tag "meta1":

    ../src/swish-e -w 'meta1=metatest1'

Again, please see L<SWISH-RUN|SWISH-RUN> and L<SWISH-CONFIG|SWISH-CONFIG>
for complete documentation of the various indexing and searching options.

=head2 Additional Examples

The above example indexes local files using the file system access method
C<-S fs>.  You may also index files that are located on a local or remote
web server by using the HTTP access method C<-S http>, or via the prog
input method C<-S prog>.  These are described in L<SWISH-RUN|SWISH-RUN>
and example configuration files for using these methods can be found in
the F<conf> directory of the Swish-e distribution.

The C<-S prog> access method can be used to index any type of document,
such as documents stored in a database (RDBMS), or documents that need
to be processed before they can be indexed.  Examples for using the
C<-S prog> method are shown in the F<prog-bin> directory.

Swish-e can also use I<filters> to convert documents as they are
processed by Swish-e.  For example, MS-Word or PDF documents can be
converted and indexed by Swish-e by using filters.  See the section on
filters in L<SWISH-CONFIG|SWISH-CONFIG>, and the examples shown in the
C<filter-bin> directory.

=head1 QUICK START FOR THE IMPATIENT

Here's I<one> example of the steps to install Swish-e, index documents by spidering, and
how to search using the included CGI script.

These steps are on Linux, and assume
that you have the libraries libxml2 and zlib installed in the system, you have a current version of Perl
and current versions of LWP, HTML:*, and HTTP:* modules installed, and Apache is installed and operating.

If you have any trouble with these instructions please read the detailed installation instructions above,
and see the documentation included with the F<swish.cgi> script and the F<spider.pl> programs.
Please don't ask for help without reading the "real" documentation first.

Not all output is included below.  You should carefully watch for errors while building Swish-e.

=over 4

=item 1 Download and build Swish-e

    ~ $ wget http://swish-e.org/<path to current swish-e version>.tar.gz
    ~ $ tar zxof <path to current swish-e version>.tar.gz
    ~ $ cd swish-e-2.2  (this directory will depend on the version of Swish-e)
    
    ~/swish-e-2.2 $ ./configure
    ~/swish-e-2.2 $ make
    ~/swish-e-2.2 $ make test
    ...
     ** All tests completed! **

=item 2 Make a working directory and copy files

    ~/swish-e-2.2 $ mkdir ~/swishtest
    ~/swish-e-2.2 $ cd ~/swishtest

    ~/swishtest $ cp ~/swish-e-2.2/src/swish-e .             
    ~/swishtest $ cp ~/swish-e-2.2/prog-bin/spider.pl .
    ~/swishtest $ cp ~/swish-e-2.2/example/swish.cgi .           
    ~/swishtest $ cp -rp ~/swish-e-2.2/example/modules/ .
    ~/swishtest $ chmod 755 swish.cgi spider.pl
    ~/swishtest $ chmod 644 modules/*

=item 3 Create the index

You must create a swish configuration file and a spider configuration
file.

    ~/swishtest $ cat swish.conf
    
    # Program to read documents
    IndexDir ./spider.pl

    # Define the config file for the spider to use
    SwishProgParameters spider.conf     

    # Use libxm2 for parsing documents
    DefaultContents HTML2
    IndexContents TXT2 txt

    # Cache document contents in the index for context display
    StoreDescription HTML2 <body>


    ~/swishtest $ cat spider.conf

    # Example spider configuration file to index the 
    # split version of the swish-e documentation

    @servers = (
        {

            base_url        => 'http://swish-e.org/2.2/docs/split/index.html',
            same_hosts      => [ qw/www.swish-e.org/ ],
            email           => 'swish-impatient@domain.invalid',
            delay_min       => .0001,

            # Define call-back functions to fine-tune the spider

            test_url        => sub {
                my $uri = shift;

                # Skip requesting files that are probably not text
                return if $uri->path =~ m[\.(?:gif|jpeg|png)$]i;


                # Limit spidering to the /2.2/docs/split/ path
                return unless $uri->path =~ m[/2.2/docs/split/];

                return 1;  # otherwise, ok to search
            },


            # Only index text/html or text/plain
            test_response   => sub {
                my ( $uri, $server, $response ) = @_;

                return $response->content_type =~ m[(?:text/html|text/plain)];
            },
        },
    );
    1;

Now begin indexing:    

    ~/swishtest $ ./swish-e -S prog -c swish.conf -v 2
