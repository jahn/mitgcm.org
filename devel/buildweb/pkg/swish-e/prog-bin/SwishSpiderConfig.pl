SwishSpiderConfig.pl - Sample swish-e spider configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a sample configuation file for the spider.pl program provided
with the swish-e distribution.

It contains settings for spidering three servers (two are the same server).
All are disabled (skip => 1) to prevent every new swish user from spidering these sites.

These are just examples.  Please spider your own web site.

**Also, please don't use this exact file as your configuration file.**

Trim your file down to just the content you need, especially
if posting your config to the Swish-e list requesting for help.  Remove these comments
and remove everything below that you are not using.

The first example is relativly simple.  It just spiders any URL that
ends in C<.html>.

The second example is a bit more advanced and shows how to filter content.

First, this the spider doesn't request image files (files that end in .gif or .jpeg)
then only indexes files with of C<text/html text/plain application/pdf application/msword> content
type.

C<application/pdf> and C<application/msword> are then run through filters to extract
out their content.  The example filter subroutines are included below, as well.

This config is set to only spider 100 URLs, or index 20 files, which ever comes first.

The third example shows more options (which are listed in C<perldoc spider.pl>), and how you might use
subroutine calls for checking URLs, content, and filtering instead of inlined subroutines shown in
the first two examples.


Please see C<perldoc spider.pl> for more information.
