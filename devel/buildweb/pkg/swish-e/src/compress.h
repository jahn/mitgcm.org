/* Here is the worst case size for a compressed number 
** MAXINTCOMPSIZE stands for MAXimum INTeger COMPressed SIZE
**
** There are many places in the code in which we allocate
** space for a compressed number. In the worst case this size is 5
** for 32 bit number, 10 for a 64 bit number.
**
** The way this compression works is reserving the first bit 
** in each byte to store a flag. The flag is set in all bytes
** except for the last one.
** This only gives 7 bits per byte to store the number.
**
** For example, to store 1000 (binary 1111101000) we will get:
** 
** 1st byte    2th byte
** 10000111    01101000
** ^           ^
** |           |
** |           Flag to indicate that this is tha last byte
** |
** Flag set to indicate that more bytes follow this one
**
** So, to compress a 32 bit number we need 5 bytes and for
** a 64 bit number we will use 10 bytes for the worst case
