**
** Swish code is going to be reorganized...
** Better module design, better structure and better code,
** better routine names and more comments (hopefully).
**
**
** This module is a  TMP MODULE   for code reorganization.
**
**
** Routines which were wrongly in other modules or are currently
** not yet assigned to a module will be tmp. moved here.
**
**
**
**
**  == when moveing a module her, shortly do a remark:
**  ==  -- why here
**  ==  -- from where 
**  ==  -- what are the plans with this routine
**  ==  -- who did it

  // rasc (2001-05-14):
  // From: result_output.c
  // Why:  totally wrong there...
  // this routine has to be moved to a new module.
  // because resultoutput has nothing to do with
  // "how to get" the index translate information.
  // (keep the new module concept tidy and clean!)

  // --> maybe there will be a new module word_rewrite.c

  // $$$ routine description missing (who ever did it)
