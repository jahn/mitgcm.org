Generally you'll want to use  "make All"  to rebuild everything from
scratch *but* if you're not changing the Latex or code-browser output
the  "make all"  will simply re-create the web visible pages without
changing conents of latex/ or vdb/.

 "make all" takes a few minutes on a P4
 "make Latex" takes about five minutes on a P4
 "make VDB" takes about few minutes on a P4
 "make All" takes about ten minutes on a P4

Targets in Makefile
 All    - does absolutely everything from scratch
 all    - removes web site and regenerates it from latex and vdb directories
 Latex  - regenerate html from latex manual
 VDB    - regenerate code-browser (vdb directory)

These other targets are not usefully employed out of context
 Templates       - create templates used in Bonniefy
 InstallSkeleton - deletes web site, installs sparse structure, manual and vdb
 Search          - Generate index for search engine
 Bonniefy        - process pages in web-site and added top/side/bottom bars
 
Makefile variables of particular interest
 TARGETDIR   - directory where the web site is installed
 LATEXROOT   - directory where the latex manual is installed
 VDBROOT     - directory where the vdb html is installed

You are not likely to need to change these other Makefile variables
 BINDIR      - directory where the bonniefy.pl and swish-e scripts are kept
 PFILESDIR   - directory where the configuration stuff is kept
 BUILDWEBDIR - normally the location of this Makefile
 SKELETON    - sparse structure
